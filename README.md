üëãüèæ Hello Frens, This project is a  Ethereum Name Service Website. 
Prerequisites
-	Writing code in JavaScript 
-	For this project I'm using Windows OS
-	MetaMask Wallet ( for this project I'm using Goerli testnet) 
-	Node.js 
-	Visual Studio Code (VSC) 
-	Gitbash 

Knowledge 

What is ENS?

ENS stands for The Ethereum Name Service, and it behaves very similar to how DNS behaves in the web2 space. As we all know that Ethereum has long addresses which are hard to remember or type. ENS solves this issue by translating these wallet addresses, hashes etc into readable domains which are then saved on Ethereum blockchain.

This dApp uses the Goeril Network

Add Goeril network to your wallet using this faucet link https://goerlifaucet.com/ 

Go to https://ens-phi-three.vercel.app/ to check out the site. 

Setup

First lets get an ENS name for your address, start by opening up https://app.ens.domains/

Website

To develop the website we will use React and Next Js. 

React is a javascript framework used to make websites. 

Next.js is a React framework that also allows writing backend APIs code along with the frontend

First, You will need to create a new next app. 

Your folder structure should look something like

- ENS
    - my-app

To create this next-app, in the terminal point to ENS folder and type  

* Note I'm using Visual Studio Code terminal ( command prompt) 

npx create-next-app@latest

and press enter 

- my-app 

No for the textscript 
No for the Elsnt 


Now to run the app, 

execute these commands in the terminal

cd my-app

npm run dev

Now go to http://localhost:3000, your app should be running ü§ò

Install the Web3Modal library. 

Web3Modal is an easy to use library to help developers easily allow their users to connect to your dApps with all sorts of different wallets.

Open up a terminal pointing atmy-app directory and execute this command

npm install web3modal

In the same terminal also 

  install ethers.js

npm install ethers



See files for the code 

styles folder  
  Home.modules.css
  
 pages folder
 
  index.js
  
  Now in your terminal which is pointing to my-app folder, 
  
  execute

npm run dev

Check out site for the final result https://ens-phi-three.vercel.app/
